<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>do not impose material costs but instead alter the underlying "choice architecture," for example by changing the default option to take advantage of people's tendency to accept defaults passively. Nudges stand in contrast to traditional policy tools, which change behavior with mandates or bans or through economic incentives (including significant subsidies or fines).</p><p>For example, a behaviorally informed policy intervention might automatically enroll people in programs designed to reduce poverty (U.S. Department of Agriculture, Food and Nutrition Service, Office of <ref type="bibr">Research and Analysis, 2013)</ref>, eliminate or reduce paperwork requirements for obtaining licenses or permits, or streamline the process of applying for government financial aid for college attendance <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bettinger, Long, Oreopoulos, &amp; Sanbonmatsu, 2012)</ref>. Many nudges have this general form; they simplify processes to make benefits more readily available. As governments decide on the appropriate level of resources to invest in nudge policies, an important question is how efficiently nudge initiatives achieve their objectives. A nudge policy that increases engagement in a desired behavior (e.g., college attendance) by a larger amount per dollar spent than a traditional intervention would be an attractive investment of public resources.</p><p>This point may seem obvious, and some nudges do produce self-evidently large behavioral changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Benartzi &amp; Thaler, 2013)</ref>. But because extremely cost-effective nudges do not always create large absolute shifts in behavior, scholars and policymakers may underappreciate their value in the absence of cost-effectiveness calculations. As a motivating case study for assessing the cost effectiveness (rather than merely the effectiveness) of nudge policies, consider an experiment conducted by the White House Social and Behavioral Sciences Team (SBST)-the U.S. nudge unit-in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD).</p><p>This experiment was intended to increase savings among military personnel in the defined-contribution retirement plan offered to federal government employees, a program in which the government already offers monetary incentives for saving (retirement-plan contributions are tax-deductible). In the experiment, most of the 806,861 military service members who were not contributing to the plan received e-mails nudging them to begin contributing (a control group received no e-mail-the business-as-usual practice). The e-mails were experimentally varied to test different behaviorally informed strategies for increasing sign-ups (see SBST-DOD Experiment in the Supplemental Material available online for further information on the experiment and its results). The business-as-usual control group had a 1.1% savings-plan enrollment rate over the month following the messaging campaign, while the groups who received e-mails had enrollment rates ranging from 1.6% to 2.1%.</p><p>At first blush, this campaign's impact seems modest. However, the incremental administrative costs of developing and deploying the e-mail campaign were just $5,000, and the messages collectively increased savingsplan enrollment by roughly 5,200 people and increased contributions by more than $1.3 million in just the first month after the experiment. 1 If we extrapolate and assume that the intervention's effect will decay linearly to zero over 1 year (a highly conservative assumption given that people rarely change their savings-plan contributions once they are set), the program increased savings by approximately $8 million total. Thus, the intervention generated $1,600 in additional savings per dollar spent by the government, an impact that is more than 100 times larger than the impact per dollar spent by the government on tax incentives, as we will report later in this article. This case study demonstrates that nudge policies do not need to produce a large impact in absolute terms to be effective.</p><p>Past studies on nudges, including those disseminated by existing nudge units, have typically measured only the extent to which an intended behavior was changed (if at all). To be maximally informative, future policy-oriented behavioral science research should measure the impact per dollar spent on behavioral interventions in comparison with more traditional interventions. In the absence of such calculations, policymakers lack the evidence needed to design optimal policies and to decide on the appropriate allocation of resources across behaviorally informed and traditional interventions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study-selection criteria</head><p>We formed a list of policy areas by combining the focus areas from the 2015 summary reports of the U.S. nudge unit (SBST, 2015) and the U.K. nudge unit (The Behavioural Insights Team, or <ref type="bibr">BIT, 2015)</ref>, eliminating redundancies and excluding areas that are not major domestic policy foci of the U.S. government. Within each policy area, we identified one well-defined behavior to be our outcome variable of interest (see Study-Selection Criteria in the Supplemental Material for details of our selection methodology). In short, when a policy area had an obvious behavior on which to focus, the choice was simple (e.g., in "Energy," we focused on energy consumption). When there was no obvious target, we used the outcome variable emphasized by the SBST. If the policy area was not studied by the SBST, we used the outcome variable emphasized by the BIT. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> displays the SBST and BIT policy areas of focus, our categorization of these areas, areas that were excluded, and outcome variables of interest.</p><p>We next searched leading academic journals for original research, published from 2000 to mid-2015, studying interventions aimed at directly influencing outcome variables of interest. Using Google Scholar to determine academic journal rankings, 2 we limited our set of academic journals to the three leading general-interest journals (Science, Nature, and Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, USA); three leading economics journals, excluding finance journals (The American Economic Review, The Quarterly Journal of Economics, and The Review of Economics and Statistics); three leading psychology journals, excluding journals that publish only review articles (Psychological Science, Journal of <ref type="bibr">Personality and Social Psychology, and Journal of Applied Psychology)</ref>; and, in the case of health, three leading general medical journals (The New England Journal of Medicine, The Lancet, and Journal of the American Medical Association).</p><p>Criteria for inclusion in our analyses were that the entire research article was available online; the article analyzed a (a) nudge, (b) tax incentive, (c) reward, or (d) educational program targeting one of the dependent variables of interest; and either the article presented the necessary information to construct relative-effectiveness calculations or we could obtain this information from the authors. (Note that reminders and streamlined or salient disclosure policies can qualify as nudges, but for our present purposes, we did not count traditional educational programs as such.) If our search for articles reporting a given outcome variable did not identify an article that met our inclusion criteria, we dropped that outcome variable from our analysis. If our search for articles studying a given outcome variable identified articles that met our inclusion criteria and that covered some but not all of the four intervention types, we attempted to fill the gaps by widening our search.</p><p>Our method for choosing dependent variables for inclusion in our relative-effectiveness analysis ensured the selection of outcomes for which the ex ante belief of policymakers was that nudges had a chance to impact behavior. This method likely gave an advantage to nudges over incentives and educational interventions in our relative-effectiveness calculations. However, it may be appropriate to confer this advantage if policymakers are indeed selective in applying nudges where they have a high potential for impact. Furthermore, we were careful to focus only on areas of major domestic policy interest (U.S. Office of <ref type="bibr">Management and Budget, 2016)</ref>, which makes our findings highly policy-relevant regardless of any selection concerns. 3</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Relative-effectiveness calculations</head><p>We compared the effectiveness of behaviorally motivated policies with the effectiveness of standard policies by using a single measure that takes both the cost of a program and its impact into account. Specifically, we examined the ratio between an intervention's causal effect on  a We grouped this focus area with SBST's focus area on promoting retirement security because its leading example concerned pensions. b We grouped this focus area with SBST's focus area on promoting program integrity and compliance because both focused on improving tax and fee collection. c For these variables, the targeted behaviors were not studied in published research articles in leading academic journals from 2000 to mid-2015 (see Method for an explanation of our journal selection criteria), so we excluded these areas from our analysis.</p><p>a given outcome variable and its (inflation-adjusted) implementation cost. We adjusted all costs to June 2015 levels using the annual consumer price index from the year of intervention. For multiyear interventions, we adjusted using the midpoint year.</p><p>Our definition of the impact of an intervention followed from the main findings of the article reporting on it. When an article reported the effect of an intervention on multiple outcome variables or target populations, we selected the outcome and target population that were most comparable with the outcomes and target populations studied in other articles on the same topic. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bettinger et al. (2012)</ref> studied the effect of Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) assistance on FAFSA completion rates, college attendance rates, Pell Grant receipt rates, and years of postsecondary education for both traditional and nontraditional students. We focused on the effect on college attendance rates among traditional students for comparability with other studies.</p><p>We often needed to make additional assumptions to produce intervention cost estimates. Some interventions affected an outcome by increasing enrollment in another program that affected the outcome. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bettinger et al. (2012)</ref> provided assistance in completing the FAFSA to increase college enrollment through improved access to financial aid. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Milkman et al. (2011)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Chapman et al. (2010)</ref> used nudges to encourage people to obtain flu shots during free vaccination campaigns. One may argue that in situations such as these, interventions have additional, indirect costs because they increase the use of other programs. However, in most of the cases we studied, the intervention simply encouraged use of existing, under-capacity institutions in a way that better fulfilled those institutions' missions. Some interventions may create perverse outcomes that are costly (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Chapman et al., 2010, reported</ref> an implementation of an opt-out vaccination appointment system that increased no-shows at a vaccination clinic), and in those situations, we explicitly accounted for those costs. That said, we did not include any indirect costs that resulted from increases in the intended use of other, existing institutions.</p><p>In most cases, the different interventions we studied within a domain operated over similar time horizons. We evaluated retirement-savings interventions over a horizon of 1 year. Similarly, college-education interventions were measured in terms of their impact on annual enrollment, and influenza-vaccination interventions operated over the course of a single year's vaccination cycle (approximately September through December). In contrast, results from energy-conservation interventions are reported for intervals ranging from a few months to several years, and we note these differences when discussing energyconservation calculations. However, even in the case of energy-conservation interventions, our relative-effectiveness calculations provide useful guidance to policymakers who apply a low intertemporal discount rate to future financial costs and energy savings.</p><p>Some experimental studies have multiple treatment conditions, and experimenters incur research costs (e.g., data-collection costs, participant payments) for all study conditions, including the control condition. Treatment effects are estimated on the basis of the marginal increase in the outcome variable in the treatment group compared with the control group, and we calculated intervention costs in the same way: as the marginal cost of the treatment relative to the cost of no treatment. We further focused our attention on capturing the primary costs for each intervention, and we omitted the costs of any minor unreported aspects of the program. 4  Of course, relative-effectiveness calculations do not address the question of whether increasing the behavior in question is socially beneficial. Our approach was to take stated government goals as given and then to address how best those goals can be achieved.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>The results of our relative-effectiveness calculations are summarized in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. Except where noted, monetary amounts are reported in 2015 dollars. Readers interested in additional details should consult Relative-Effectiveness Calculations in the Supplemental Material.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Increasing retirement savings</head><p>We first investigated the effectiveness of interventions designed to increase retirement savings (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Carroll, Choi, Laibson, Madrian, and Metrick (2009)</ref> studied an active-decision nudge for retirement savings. A company's new employees were required to indicate their preferred contribution rate in a workplace savings plan within their first month of employment. Compared with an enrollment system that asked employees to choose a contribution rate on their own and that implemented a default contribution rate of zero for employees who had not chosen another rate, the active-decision nudge increased the average contribution rate in the first year of employment by more than 1% of salary. The nudge was effective because it ensured that procrastination would not prevent new employees from signing up for the plan <ref type="bibr">(O'Donoghue &amp; Rabin, 1999)</ref>.</p><p>We conservatively applied the average contributionrate increase of 1 percentage point to an annual salary of $20,000 (well below these employees' median income), for a contribution increase of $200 per employee. We estimated that the cost of including the savings-plan enrollment form in the information packet for new hires and following up with the 5% of employees who failed to</p></div>

Perhaps the best-known nudges for promoting savings in workplace retirement accounts enroll employees automatically, use automatic escalation to increase their contribution rates, or employ a combination of these two nudges. Automatic enrollment is effective because people exhibit inertia, which favors sticking to defaults; because people infer that policymakers are recommending the default option; and because defaults become reference points, which makes deviations from the default feel like losses, which loom larger than gains <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">( Johnson &amp; Goldstein, 2003)</ref>. The most definitive study of automatic enrollment in savings plans used data from Denmark (Chetty, Friedman, Leth-Petersen, Nielsen, &amp; Olsen,  <ref type="formula">2003</ref>) tested a traditional educational intervention, offering a university's employees $20 to attend a benefits fair to receive information about its retirement savings plan. This intervention increased plan contributions over the next year by $58.95 at a cost of $4.04 per employee, generating $14.58 in additional contributions in the year per dollar spent. <ref type="bibr">(Choi, Laibson, &amp; Madrian, 2011</ref>, analyzed a similar intervention but did not find a statistically significant impact, so the Duflo &amp; Saez results are potentially overly optimistic.) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Duflo, Gale, Liebman, Orszag, and Saez (2006)</ref> provided clients of a tax-preparation company with matching contributions for deposits to a retirement-savings account. Clients who were offered a 20% match contributed $76.90 more to the account relative to the control group (which received 0% matching) and received average matching contributions of $16.70, for total incremental contributions of $93.60 per treated client and a mere $5.59 in total contributions per dollar of matching expenditures. This pattern of results held for clients who were offered a 50% match: They contributed $162.10 more to the account relative to the control group and received average matching contributions of $82.40, for total incremental contributions of $244.50 per treated client and only $2.97 in total contributions per dollar of matching expenditures. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Duflo et al. (2006)</ref> also calculated the effect of tax credits on retirement-account contributions, but we focused on the results from a companion article <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Duflo, Gale, Liebman, Orszag, &amp; Saez, 2007)</ref> devoted specifically to studying these tax credits. The authors estimated that an increase in the tax credit from 20% to 50% of contributions would generate an additional $11.60 of deposits to a retirement account, from an average of $12.00 to $23.50. This increase translates to just $1.24 ($11.60/(0.50 × 23.50 -0.20 × 12.00)) of retirement savings per dollar of tax credits.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Increasing college enrollment among recent high school graduates</head><p>Next, we turned to interventions designed to increase college enrollment among recent high school graduates (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>). We began by examining a nudge intervention undertaken by the tax-preparation company, H&amp;R Block. When H&amp;R Block facilitated the process of filing the FAFSA for its clients, high school seniors whose families received the assistance were 8.1 percentage points more likely to attend college the following year than seniors in the control group (whose families did not receive the assistance). The incremental cost of this nudge intervention over the cost for the control group was $53.02 per participant. Thus, it produced 1.53 additional college enrollees per $1,000 spent <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bettinger et al., 2012)</ref>. This streamlined personalized-assistance nudge likely reduced procrastination by making the FAFSA easier to complete, alleviated anxiety about making errors, reduced the stigma for low-socioeconomic-status individuals associated with filling out the FAFSA, and increased the salience and perceived value of completing it. When this nudge was replaced with a more traditional educational intervention providing families with details about their aid eligibility, there was a statistically insignificant decrease in college enrollment relative to that in the untreated control group <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bettinger et al., 2012)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Dynarski (2003)</ref> estimated the effect of the Social Security Student Benefit Program, a federal subsidy for postsecondary education, on college enrollment. The elimination of benefit eligibility reduced attendance rates for affected students by 18.2 percentage points. The average annual subsidy for each student in 1980 was $9,252, and 56% of the eligible group attended college for a cost per eligible individual of $5,181. The program therefore generated 0.0351 additional college enrollees per $1,000 spent (0.182/5,181 × 1,000). This impact per $1,000 spent is approximately 40 times smaller than the corresponding impact of the <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bettinger et al. (2012)</ref> nudge. 6  Long (2004a) studied state higher education subsidies for enrollment in public universities. Long's estimates indicate that in the absence of any state support, 5,535 students in the sample would enroll in college. If the state provided vouchers proportional to the expected years of study, 5,664 students would enroll, with 3,766 in 4-year colleges and 1,898 in 2-year colleges. According to the working-paper version of the article, the vouchers provide $5,367 per student at a 4-year college and $2,683 per student at a 2-year college.

In the opt-out group, 39 people changed or canceled appointments. In the opt-in group, 50 people scheduled appointments (none were changed or canceled). We assume that a clinic must provide enough staff to cover the number of people who have appointments or the number of people who keep their appointment plus the number of walk-ins, whichever is greater, for a total of 221 appointments for the opt-out group and 80 appointments and walk-ins for the opt-in group. We also assume that clinics accurately anticipate the proportion of people who keep their automatic appointments, which means that the number of vaccines that expire is negligible. The opt-out condition then had a total cost of $1,153.75 ($1.25 × 39 + $5 × 221) in 2009 dollars, while the opt-in condition had a total cost of $462.50 ($1.25 × 50 + $5 × 80) in 2009 dollars, so the inflation-adjusted marginal cost of the opt-out condition was $766.06.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In this research, we extracted critical new information from past work by calculating comparable relative-effectiveness numbers and examining them side by side to illustrate how different interventions measure up on this important dimension. The results hardly provide an exhaustive review of the relative effectiveness of nudges compared with traditional policy tools, such as bans and incentives. Nonetheless, our selective but systematic calculations indicate that the impact of nudges is often greater, on a cost-adjusted basis, than that of traditional tools.</p><p>In which situations are nudges more impactful per dollar spent than traditional policy tools and vice versa <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Goldin &amp; Lawson, 2016)</ref>? Far more work needs to be done on this question <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Goldin &amp; Lawson, 2016)</ref>, but monetary incentives may well do better, along that dimension, when the policymaker's objective is to correct a misalignment between the public interest and the private interests of citizens making carefully reasoned decisions (as in cases in which private decisions impose externalities). To be sure, nudges can help even there, and sometimes they may be preferable <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Sunstein &amp; Reisch, 2014)</ref>. But their comparative advantages will typically be greater when the policymaker's objective is to change the day-to-day behavior of individuals who are making biased, rushed, or otherwise imperfect decisions, in which imperfection is judged by reference to the welfare of those same individuals. As Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">2 through 5</ref> show, monetary incentives in these settings can generate large increases in desirable behavior, but are sometimes too expensive to generate a favorable ratio of impact to cost. Because traditional interventions are intended to change behavior by altering the cost-benefit calculation that individuals undertake when focusing on a particular decision, these interventions face the challenge that individuals' ability (and desire) to engage high-level cognitive capacities is often limited <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Shah, Mullainathan, &amp; Shafir, 2012)</ref>. Nudges, by contrast, can succeed because they account for individuals' intuitions, emotions, and automatic decision-making processes. These processes can be triggered or enlisted with simple cues and subtle changes to the choice environment, so nudges can be effective yet cheap, generating high impact per dollar spent.</p><p>Should nudges therefore replace traditional policy tools? Sometimes, but often not, and so it would be a mistake to jump to this conclusion. As the case of externalities reveals, nudges are not always the best tool for pursuing policy objectives, and prohibitions and mandates have their place (consider the problem of violent crime). In many cases, nudges work in concert with other tools, which makes it easier for individuals to take advantage of beneficial programs and subsidies that are already in place. For example, the retirement-savings activedecision nudge directed greater attention to an existing savings plan, the FAFSA intervention increased college attendance by simplifying the process of applying for student aid programs, and the vaccination-planning prompts helped individuals to focus on how they could follow through on the intention to attend an existing free workplace clinic. Automatic enrollment in savings plans and default flu-shot appointments required no up-front effort on the part of individuals but nonetheless started them down the path of engaging with existing savings plans and free vaccination clinics, respectively.</p><p>An important caveat to our calculations is that they are not apples-to-apples exercises: They compared the effectiveness of different interventions without holding fixed the population studied. We lack sufficient studies comparing multiple policy interventions simultaneously across similar populations. It would also be desirable to examine additional consequences of interventions beyond their effects on the narrow behavior targeted (e.g., costs incurred by individuals as they react to the interventions; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Allcott &amp; Kessler, 2015)</ref>. Notably, the operational philosophy of nudging is to test competing behavioral interventions and then to cull ineffective ones from the portfolio of nudges. This rapid testing cyclealong with the low cost of deploying most nudges in the first place-increases the likelihood that failures will be inexpensive.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>We offer three recommendations. First, there should be increased investment in behaviorally informed policies to supplement traditional policies both inside and outside of governments. Second, nudge units and other organizations enlisting nudges should share data and knowledge (e.g., through a central repository) and coordinate efforts to maximize their learning from one another. Tracking failures is as important for knowledge creation as tracking successes. Third, behavioral scientists should measure relative effectiveness explicitly in their studies in order to quantify the impact of nudge interventions compared with other available policy tools (and to learn which nudge interventions work best). Nudging has entered governments in the United Kingdom, in the United States, and far beyond, but in light of growing evidence of its relative effectiveness, we believe that policymakers should nudge more.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Notes</head><p>1. This estimate is relative to our estimate of what would have happened had everyone been in the control group. To estimate the overall effect of the e-mail campaign on enrollment, we ran an ordinary least squares (OLS) regression with an indicator for enrollment as the outcome variable and with only a constant and an indicator variable for receiving an e-mail as the explanatory variables. Multiplying the point estimate (and the end points of the 95% confidence interval) for the coefficient on the e-mail indicator variable by the number of individuals who received e-mails, we estimated that the e-mail campaign increased savingsprogram enrollment by 5,265 people (95% confidence interval = <ref type="bibr">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr">563,</ref><ref type="bibr">5,</ref><ref type="bibr">968]</ref>). Using the same methodology, we also estimated that the e-mail campaign increased total contributions to retirement accounts in the month following the e-mail campaign by $1,367,423. Note that this last calculation excludes Marines and is therefore an understatement of the effect. 2. See <ref type="url" target="https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=top_venues">https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=top_venues</ref>. Our results were obtained September 29, 2015. 3. Another potential concern is that our process for selecting research articles might be likely to identify false-positive results. We have conducted p-curve analyses for the key results identified by our process. The results concerning nudge interventions have evidential value, as do the results concerning traditional interventions (see Evidential Value of the Underlying Studies in the Supplemental Material). 4. This may have led us to account for a category of cost in one setting but not in another. For example, administrative and marketing costs for a purely informational intervention may be the most significant costs of the intervention, and we would therefore have included them in our cost accounting. However, for grant programs or tax credits, administrative and marketing costs are small in relation to the total amount of money transferred, so accounting for them would not significantly affect our estimates. Thus, we did not explicitly incorporate such costs. 5. We converted Danish kroner to U.S. dollars using the 6.5-to-1 exchange rate preferred by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Chetty et al. (2014)</ref>, and we then adjusted from 1999 to 2015 price levels. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Chetty et al. (2014)</ref> also studied the extent to which savings increases in a retirement account caused by changes to automatic contributions or caused by changes to tax incentives are offset by savings decreases in an individual's other financial accounts. The offset is minor in the case of changes to automatic contributions. However, when savings in a retirement account are altered in response to changes to tax incentives for the account, this response is almost completely offset by adjustments in other accounts. The other articles that we analyzed did not report results regarding the extent of such offsetting because the data were not available. 6. Note that <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Dynarski (2003)</ref> evaluated the elimination of an incentive rather than the addition of an incentive, which may not have symmetric effects given past research showing that losses loom larger than gains <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1979)</ref>. Other researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Linsenmeier, Rosen, &amp; Rouse, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Conley &amp; Taber, 2011)</ref> did not find statistically significant estimates of the effect of grants on college enrollment. Our focus on the <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Dynarski (2003)</ref> results was a potentially overly optimistic view of the effect of educational subsidies. 7. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Sexton (2015)</ref> demonstrated that withdrawing consumers from automatic electricity-bill payment programs significantly reduced energy usage. This intervention does not fit into any of the traditional policy categories we evaluated; it comes closest to being a nudge. We excluded it from our analysis because it imposed significant transaction costs on consumers and therefore is not truly a nudge.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0"><head>Table 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Categorization of Social and Behavioral Sciences Team (SBST) and Behavioural Insights Team (BIT) Focus Areas</figDesc><table><row><cell></cell><cell>Corresponding focus area in</cell><cell>Corresponding focus area in</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Our categorization</cell><cell>SBST 2015 Annual Report</cell><cell>BIT 2013-2015 Update Report</cell><cell>Outcome variable of interest</cell></row><row><cell>Financial security</cell><cell>Promoting retirement security</cell><cell>Empowering consumers a</cell><cell>Retirement savings</cell></row><row><cell>in retirement</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Education</cell><cell>Improving college access and</cell><cell>Education</cell><cell>College enrollment among recent</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>affordability</cell><cell></cell><cell>high school graduates</cell></row><row><cell>Energy</cell><cell>N/A</cell><cell>Energy and sustainability</cell><cell>Energy consumption</cell></row><row><cell>Health</cell><cell>Helping families get health</cell><cell>Health and well-being</cell><cell>Adult outpatient influenza</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>coverage and stay healthy</cell><cell></cell><cell>vaccinations</cell></row><row><cell>Job training</cell><cell>Advancing economic</cell><cell>Economic growth and the</cell><cell>Enrollment in job-training programs c</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>opportunity</cell><cell>labor market; skills and youth</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Program integrity</cell><cell>Promoting program integrity</cell><cell>Fraud, error, and debt b</cell><cell>Compliance with paying a required</cell></row><row><cell>and compliance</cell><cell>and compliance</cell><cell></cell><cell>fee to the government c</cell></row><row><cell>Home affairs</cell><cell>N/A</cell><cell>Home affairs</cell><cell>Reducing crimes such as illegal</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>migration, mobile-phone theft, and</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>online exploitation c</cell></row><row><cell cols="4">Note: Our list excluded the following SBST and BIT focus areas because they are not major areas of domestic policy for the U.S. government:</cell></row><row><cell cols="4">ensuring cost-effective program operations (SBST), giving and social action (BIT), international development (BIT), and work with other</cell></row><row><cell>governments (BIT).</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row></table></figure>
