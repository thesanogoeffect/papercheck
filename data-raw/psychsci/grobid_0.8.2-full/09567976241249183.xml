<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In this article, we focus on framing effects in choices involving risk and on how such effects depend on the descriptions of the options.</p><p>Consider the archetypal "Asian disease problem" (ADP; <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1981)</ref>, in which 600 people are at risk and the choice is between a certain option and a risky option with the same expected value. In the gain frame, the certain option is "200 people will be saved," and the risky option is "a 1/3 probability that 600 people will be saved and a 2/3 probability that no people will be saved." In the loss frame, the options are, respectively, "400 people will die" and "a 1/3 probability that no people will die and a 2/3 probability that 600 people will die." Usually, the certain option is preferred in gains, and the risky option is preferred in losses. This shift is considered a framing effect because the options in the two frames are arguably equivalent (e.g., saving 200 people implies that 400 die), though this view is not uncontroversial <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Chick et al., 2016;</ref>  </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Changing the option descriptions can alter the results. For example, when the certain option is described completely, as "200 people will be saved and 400 people will not be saved" in gains and as "200 people will not die and 400 people will die" in losses (Variant 1), the framing effect is typically eliminated <ref type="bibr">(De Boeck et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">DeKay et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Kühberger, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Mandel, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Tombu &amp; Mandel, 2015)</ref>. When the certain option includes only the complement of the original information, so that it becomes "400 people will not be saved" in gains and "200 people will not die" in losses (Variant 2), the framing effect is reversed <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Kühberger, 1995)</ref>. The risky option may also be described incompletely. When the nonzero outcome is omitted, the risky option becomes "a 2/3 probability that no people will be saved" in gains and "a 1/3 probability that no people will die" in losses <ref type="bibr">(Variant 3)</ref>. In this version, the framing effect is amplified <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Chick et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Kühberger &amp; Tanner, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Reyna &amp; Brainerd, 1991</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Reyna et al., 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Reyna et al., , 2021;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Zhou et al., 2021)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Broniatowski and Reyna's (2018)</ref> review describes these variants plus three others. In all cases but one (Variant 1), different aspects of the options are described in gains and losses. This observation raises the intriguing possibility that nonzero framing effects in either direction arise solely from mismatched comparisons.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical Accounts</head><p>We highlight three accounts of the risky-choice framing effect, in historical order. According to prospect theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1992)</ref>, decision makers adopt different reference points in the two frames. Prospect theory then explains the standard framing effect with its S-shaped value function, its inverse-S-shaped weighting function, or their combination (for details, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">DeKay &amp; Garge, 2023)</ref>. However, prospect theory generally fails to predict changes in the direction and magnitude of the framing effect across variants. For example, it is not clear how to apply prospect theory's functions to negations like "400 people will not be saved" <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Kühberger &amp; Tanner, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Mandel, 2001)</ref>.</p><p>Fuzzy-trace theory (FTT; <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Broniatowski &amp; Reyna, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Reyna, 2012)</ref> explains framing effects on the basis of the categorical gist of the options. In the gain frame of the ADP, the categorical representations of the certain and risky options are, respectively, "some people will be saved" and "some people will be saved or no people will be saved"; the comparison favors the certain option. In losses, the distinction between "some people will die" and "no people will die or some people will die" favors the risky option. FTT, especially as formalized by Broniatowski and Reyna, also accounts for the results in ADP variants, mostly with categorical comparisons. In Variant 3, FTT's additional ordinal comparisons (e.g., saving 200 people is better than saving no people) account for the larger framing effect. 1 Critical tests involving incompletely described risky options favor FTT over prospect theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Reyna et al., 2023</ref>, provide a recent summary).</p><p>Finally, in the explicated valence account (EVA; <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Tombu &amp; Mandel, 2015)</ref>, preferences follow from categorical comparisons involving the valences of the option descriptions. In the gain frame of the ADP, the certain option's positive valence is preferred to the risky option's mixed valence. In losses, the risky option's mixed valence is preferred to the certain option's negative valence. These comparisons are nearly identical to FTT's categorical gist comparisons. Consequently, EVA also performs well in ADP variants, though it requires an extension to explain the amplified framing effect in Variant 3. We provide such an extension below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A Framework and a Model</head><p>The variants reviewed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Broniatowski and Reyna (2018)</ref> do not exhaust the possibilities. The certain and risky options can each be described using the good aspect only, the bad aspect only, or both aspects. There are thus nine possible pairings of certain and risky</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statement of Relevance</head><p>Understanding risky choices involving finances (invest aggressively for retirement?), health (get another vaccine?), business (launch a new product?), and policy (restrict carbon emissions?) is a key goal of decision psychology. Some accounts of such choices are based on the expectations of options (i.e., weighting outcomes by their likelihoods), whereas others depend on simpler comparisons involving the valence or gist of options. The latter accounts are particularly good at explaining how people's preferences for risky or riskless options change depending on the information included in the option descriptions. These accounts predict that a famous choice pattern called the risky-choice framing effect will disappear once differences between the option descriptions are taken into account. The experiment reported here-the most comprehensive on this topic to date-shows that the famous pattern is reduced but not eliminated. The implication is that explaining people's risky choices requires more than one type of psychological theory. descriptions in each frame. In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, these are labeled G1 to G9 in gains and L1 to L9 in losses. The standard framing effect involves cells G4 and L6, whereas Variants 1, 2, and 3 involve cells <ref type="bibr">G5 and L5, G6 and L4, and G7 and L3, respectively.</ref> For predictions, we propose an interval-scaled version of EVA; the scaling assumption is a convenience that permits some arithmetic. (Below, we consider other specifications of EVA and FTT.) The valence of an option description is coded +1 if only the positive aspect is included, -1 if only the negative aspect is included, and 0 if both aspects are included (see the row and column labels in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). Across the 18 cells, the choice proportion for the risky option is predicted to be an increasing function of the valence difference, ValenceDiff = Valence Risky -Valence Certain , which ranges from -2 to +2. For example, in the gain frame of the standard framing effect (cell G4), ValenceDiff = -1, indicating a preference for the certain option. In the loss frame (cell L6), Valence-Diff = +1, indicating a preference for the risky option. In this version of EVA, the positive-versus-negative valence differences in cells G3, G7, L3, and L7 are twice as large as the positive-versus-mixed and mixed-versusnegative differences in other cells.</p><p>For any pair of gain and loss cells, the framing effect (FE) is predicted by the difference between the valence differences in the two frames. We use FE pred = (Valence-Diff Losses -ValenceDiff Gains )/2, which equals +1 for the standard framing effect. In notation that conveys the direction of subtraction, the standard comparison is L6-G4. For the variants described above, the values of FE pred are 0 (no framing effect) for Variant 1 (L5-G5), -1 (a reversed framing effect) for Variant 2 (L4-G6), and +2 (a larger framing effect) for Variant 3 (L3-G7).</p><p>In all, there are 81 possible comparisons of gain and loss cells. For the nine matched comparisons (L1-G1, . . ., L9-G9), FE pred is always zero. The other 72 comparisons are mismatched, with FE pred ranging from -2 (strongly reversed) to +2 (amplified).</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> provides option descriptions for all 18 cells of an example problem.

For example, the inclusion or omission of zero or nonzero outcomes is important in FTT. Cells G2 and L8 match in the sense that the risky options include only the nonzero outcome in each frame, but they do not match in the sense considered here because those outcomes are different (600 people will be saved vs. 600 people will die).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Alternative Models</head><p>Table 2 also lists predicted preferences from different versions of EVA and FTT. Considering alternative models provides a robustness check for our primary results and allows for comparisons of theoretical accounts. For original EVA, we set the positive-versus-negative valence difference equal to the positive-versus-mixed and mixed-versus-negative valence differences (i.e., we replaced values of ±2 with ±1), which seems consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Tombu and Mandel's (2015)</ref> treatment of valences as being either the same or different. In another specification, we allowed the three types of nonzero valence differences to have different coefficients.</p><p>We considered two interpretations of FTT, both of which make the same predictions as interval-scaled EVA for at least 12 of the 18 cells. In cell G3, both FTT interpretations predict a one-unit preference for the risky option (+1 rather than +2) on the basis of the categorical difference between "some people are saved" and "some people are not saved." The ordinal comparison, which accounts for amplified preferences (±2) in other cells, is indeterminate because the categories are disjoint <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Broniatowski &amp; Reyna, 2018)</ref>. Similar logic holds for cell L7.</p><p>For the four remaining cells (G8, G9, L1, and L2), FTT's predictions hinge on categorical comparisons between "some people are not saved" and "no people are saved" in gains and between "some people do not die" and "no people die" in losses. Although <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Broniatowski and Reyna (2018)</ref> did not address these comparisons directly, our preferred interpretation (FTT1) follows from their text (see the Supplemental Material available online for details). For gain-framed problems, FTT holds (a) that "no people are saved" is a subset of "some people are saved" and (b) that "some people are saved" is preferred to "some people are not saved." Together, these relationships seem to imply that "no people are saved" is preferred to "some people are not saved." Interpreting "no people are saved" as neither a gain nor a loss and "some people are not saved" as a loss (even in gain-framed problems; pp. 229-230) yields the same conclusion. Similar logic applies to loss-framed problems. It follows that the risky option is preferred in cell G9, and the certain option is preferred in cell L1, for example. In an alternate interpretation (FTT2), the categories in question are equally preferred (or not comparable) and thus do not contribute to option preferences. In FTT2, predictions differ from those of interval-scaled EVA only for cells G3 and L7.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A More Complete, Balanced Experiment</head><p>Although some cells of Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> and <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> have been well studied, we know of no studies of cells G3, G8, L2, or L7, only two studies of cells G6 and L4 (both in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Kühberger, 1995)</ref>, and only two studies of cells G9 and L1 (both in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Mandel, 2001)</ref>. Additionally, studies have used different participant populations, instructions, and problem domains.</p><p>We used a more complete, balanced design in which option descriptions were not confounded with frame. We hypothesized that choice proportions in all cells would be well predicted by interval-scaled EVA (and other versions of EVA and FTT) and that there would be no residual framing effect once valence and gist were accounted for. To foreshadow the results, we were correct on the first count but not the second.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>We used two convenient groups of participants. In fall 2019, we used CloudResearch to recruit 1,010 participants on Amazon Mechanical Turk for an incentive of $0.50. To safeguard data quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Chmielewski &amp; Kucker, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Peer et al., 2022)</ref>, we recruited only U.S. workers who had approval ratings of at least 99% and who had completed at least 500 tasks, we verified their country locations, and we blocked duplicate IP addresses and suspicious geocode locations. We justify our target sample size of 900 participants in the Design section below. Because the CloudResearch sample yielded a surprising result for the residual framing effect, we sought to replicate our results in a student sample like those used in most previous research on framing-effect variants. In spring 2020, we recruited 651 undergraduates from the Department of Psychology at The Ohio State University. Students received course credit for their online participation. This research was determined to be exempt from Institutional Review Board review by The Ohio State University's Office of Responsible Research Practices (ID: 2018E0239 and 2020E0121).</p><p>We excluded participants who were flagged by Qualtrics as fraudulent or duplicates (41 and 87 in the two samples, respectively), as well as those who finished the task too quickly (25, 10) or too slowly (6, 8), skipped more than one of the eight choice and rating questions (9, 2), or answered any pair of choice and rating questions inconsistently (23, 23; see the Supplemental Material). After exclusions, 906 and 521 participants remained in the two samples, respectively. CloudResearch participants were from 49 states (plus Washington, DC) and were 18 to 74 years old (M = 37.4 years, SD = 11.3), whereas the students were mostly from Ohio (82.5%) and were 18 to 50 years old (M = 19.6 years, SD = 2.7). Among CloudResearch participants (and student participants in parentheses), 52.6% (51.8%) identified as female, 46.9% (47.6%) as male, and 0.6% (0.6%) as other genders; 81.4% (72.7%) identified as White, 7.2% (5.4%) as Black or African American, 6.6% (14.6%) as Asian, 2.3% (3.5%) as other races, and 2.4% (3.8%) as mixed race; 7.7% (5.2%) also identified as Hispanic or Latino/a.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>In an anonymous survey, participants responded to four randomly ordered scenarios that differed by domain (e.g., disease, investment), in either the gain or loss frame for all domains. In each scenario, participants made a binary choice between two programs: Program A was a certain option, and Program B was an all-ornone risky option with the same expected value. Participants also indicated their strength of preference on a 7-point scale with endpoints labeled strong preference for Program A [or B] and with the midpoint labeled no preference at all.</p><p>The four scenarios involved an infectious disease with 3,000 people at risk, a financial investment with $15,000 at risk, a wildfire with 7,200 animals at risk, and a drought with 24,000 acres of crops at risk (see the Supplemental Material for details; the latter three scenarios were based on those in <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Peters &amp; Levin, 2008)</ref>. To reduce redundancy, we varied the value and wording of the probability of the better outcome in the risky option across the four domains ("a 2/5 probability," "a one out of three chance," "a one-fourth probability," and "a 50% chance," respectively). Framing effects are relatively insensitive to variations in moderate probabilities and probability formats <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(DeKay et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">DeKay &amp; Garge, 2023)</ref>.</p><p>At the end of the survey, participants answered a few demographic and debriefing questions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Design</head><p>Each participant was assigned to one of the 18 cells in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. An additional complication was that whenever the description of the certain option or the risky option included both good and bad aspects, as occurred in 10 of the 18 cells, either the good aspect or the bad aspect could be mentioned first. Rather than choosing one of these orders, we used both, which yielded a total of 28 conditions. (In the center cells, G5 and L5, we omitted the mixed combinations in which the certain and risky options could be described in different orders in the same problem.)</p><p>For the CloudResearch sample, we wanted at least 30 participants in each cell to ensure a minimum sample size of 60 participants (240 choices) in each comparison (e.g., L5-G5). However, for our regression analysis, we also wanted roughly equal sample sizes at each of the five levels of the ValenceDiff variable (-2, -1, 0, 1, and 2). We therefore oversampled the eight cells with ValenceDiff = ±1 (n ≈ 45 each) and the four cells with ValenceDiff = ±2 (n ≈ 90 each). The target sample size was thus 900. We collected data from about 1,000 participants to allow for exclusions. We had the same goal for the student sample, but we set a minimum acceptable sample size of 300 by the end of the semester (30 participants in each frame at each level of ValenceDiff).</p><p>We did not base our target sample size on formal power analyses, partly because we had very different predictions for the effects of ValenceDiff and Frame. If framing effects are really due to differences in the valence or gist of options, one might expect a two-unit difference in ValenceDiff to yield an effect size (d) similar to that for the standard framing effect (L6-G4), which was 0.60 in the Many Labs replication effort <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Klein et al., 2014)</ref>. Because ValenceDiff spanned four units in our design (-2 to 2), we did not doubt our ability to detect such an effect. On the other hand, our interval-scaled EVA model predicts that the residual effect of Frame should be zero, and the results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Broniatowski and Reyna's (2018)</ref> review are consistent with a zero or near-zero effect. It did not seem reasonable to chase power for an effect size near zero.</p><p>Nonetheless, subsequent simulation-based power analyses <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Kumle et al., 2021)</ref> that were not based in any way on our observed data indicated that we had substantial power for detecting very small (d = 0.10) or small (d = 0.20) effects in our primary model for predicting participants' choices (see the Supplemental Material). With 900 participants (our target), power was .999 for a very small effect of ValenceDiff and .96 for a small residual effect of Frame. With 500 participants (slightly fewer than in our student sample), power was .97 for a very small effect of ValenceDiff and .81 for a small effect of Frame. Obtaining power greater than .80 for a very small effect of Frame would have required more than 2,000 participants.</p><p>For tests involving only two of the 18 cells, power was lower but still acceptable in many cases. For the standard framing effect (L6-G4, target n = 90), power was .94 for the Many Labs effect size (d = 0.60; <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Klein et al., 2014)</ref> and .84 for a medium effect (d = 0.50).

For the standard framing effect, CloudResearch participants chose the risky option 21.9% of the time in the gain frame (cell G4) and 52.7% of the time in the loss frame (cell L6; difference = 30.8 percentage points). In the student sample, the corresponding percentages were 22.5% and 40.5% (difference = 18.0). For comparison, the percentages in the Many Labs replication of the ADP were 37.8% and 66.5% (difference = 28.7; <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Klein et al., 2014)</ref>. Although our results indicate a lack of risk seeking (or even risk aversion) in losses, the differences between gains and losses are consistent with a traditional framing effect.</p><p>To assess the significance of the standard framing effect, we used mixed-effects logistic regression (run using the glmer function in R's lme4 package; <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bates et al., 2015)</ref> to model the probability that participants chose the risky option. We included a random intercept for participants because they each made four choices. The only predictor, Frame, was coded -0.5 for gains and 0.5 for losses, so that a positive coefficient would indicate a traditional framing effect. The framing effect was significant in the CloudResearch sample, b = 2.18, 95% confidence interval (CI) =  Note: Each participant made four choices in one of the 18 cells.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Eighty-one possible framing effects</head><p>Most tests of framing effects compare one cell in the gain frame to one cell in the loss frame. The option descriptions in the cells can be matched, as in Variant 1 from the introduction (L5-G5), but they are usually mismatched, as in the original ADP and the other variants considered by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Broniatowski and Reyna (2018)</ref>.</p><p>To illustrate the importance of such pairings, we computed the framing effect separately for each of the 81 possible comparisons of gain and loss cells in each sample.</p><p>The results appear in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, where we have highlighted the standard framing effect, the six variants from Broniatowski and Reyna's (2018) review, and two new variants (L2-G8 and L7-G3) created from the four cells that were absent from that review. These nine comparisons are independent in the sense that each relies on information from different cells of the design. The remaining comparisons (in gray) rely on recombinations of the same information.</p><p>Overall, the framing effects followed the predictions of interval-scaled EVA relatively well in both samples. For example, the new L7-G3 comparison yielded a very strong reversed framing effect, as predicted. However, the entire pattern was shifted upward toward more positive framing effects, especially in the CloudResearch sample. When FE pred &gt; 0, the observed framing effects were usually significantly positive, but when FE pred &lt; 0, the observed framing effects were often not significantly negative.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Alternative models</head><p>Beyond our preregistered analyses, we also compared the performance of interval-scaled EVA to other specifications of EVA and to FTT as well, using the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) as the metric. The results presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref> are for logistic models of participants' choices; results for linear models of participants' preference ratings were essentially identical (see Table <ref type="table">S8</ref> in the Supplemental Material). We first note that removing the interaction term from our primary model improved the performance of interval-scaled EVA in both samples, as indicated by the decrease in BIC (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>). A difference of 6 to 10 is strong evidence in favor of the model with the lower BIC; a difference greater than 10 is very strong evidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Raftery, 1995)</ref>. We omitted the interaction(s) from the other models as well because doing so improved their performance.</p><p>In addition to interval-scaled EVA and original EVA, we considered a third specification in which we allowed each of the three nonzero valence differences (positive vs. mixed, mixed vs. negative, and positive vs. negative) to have its own coefficient (see the Supplemental Material). Original EVA and this free-valence-differences version both performed worse than interval-scaled EVA in both samples (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>). In the version with more parameters, the coefficient for the positive-versus- negative valence difference was more than twice as large as the coefficients for the other valence differences in both samples. Both versions of FTT also performed worse than interval-scaled EVA in both samples (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>).</p><p>The relative performance of the models in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>, as indicated by the order of their BIC scores, was identical in the two samples (also see Table <ref type="table">S8</ref> in the Supplemental Material). However, despite the stability of these performance differences, all models yielded the same basic results: The coefficients for the valence-and gistbased predictors were always substantial and significant (all ps ≤ .006), as were the coefficients for the residual framing effect (all ps ≤ .008).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The ubiquity of risk in decisions about finances, health, and other matters makes it important to understand how and why framing affects such choices. Our results indicate that well-known and extensively studied riskychoice framing effects stem partly from mismatched comparisons in which the option descriptions include different information (with different gist) in the gain and loss frames. More precisely, the mix of good and bad information in option descriptions and the framing of that information in positive or negative terms appear to have separate, additive effects on choices. More broadly, the observed effects of presenting versus omitting information align with findings on intertemporal choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Magen et al., 2008)</ref>, opportunity-cost neglect <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Frederick et al., 2009)</ref>, risk perception <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Fischhoff et al., 1978)</ref>, and other decision-making phenomena <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Kahneman, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Our results are both good news and bad news for valence-and gist-based accounts of framing. On the positive side, all specifications of EVA and FTT successfully predicted variation in response proportions across the numerous problems in our experiment; prospect theory cannot do that. On the negative side, there was still a substantial framing effect even after valence or gist had been accounted for, suggesting that other mechanisms also contribute. This result conflicts with the previous literature for these types of problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Broniatowski &amp; Reyna, 2018)</ref>, though gaps in that literature and differences between studies complicate comparisons. Other findings also suggest that framing effects are multiply determined. For example, none of several prominent accounts can fully explain response patterns in problems with more extreme probabilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(DeKay &amp; Garge, 2023)</ref> or with intermediate, somewhat risky options in place of the usual certain and all-or-none options <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(DeKay et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Garge, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Schneider, 1992)</ref>.</p><p>A more specific result is that interval-scaled EVA outperformed other versions of EVA and FTT. However, the evaluation of FTT was hampered by the theory's opacity regarding some categorical comparisons.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A potential limitation</head><p>Some participants in our experiment may have considered incomplete option descriptions to be ambiguous <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Fisher &amp; Mandel, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Kühberger &amp; Tanner, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Mandel, 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Mandel, , 2014;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Okder, 2012)</ref>. For example, "200 people will be saved" could be interpreted as "at least 200 people will be saved." When construed in this way, mismatched options like those in the ADP can yield (apparent) framing effects because the certain and risky options seem to have different expected values. As <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Mandel (2001)</ref> noted, the problem is not ambiguity per se but rather the asymmetry of ambiguity across frames (i.e., in mismatched comparisons). However, framing effects persist when participants are trained to correctly complete the incomplete descriptions, undermining the ambiguity explanation <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Chick et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Reyna et al., 2021)</ref>. Regardless, the potential for ambiguity was the same in both frames in our matched comparisons and in our overall analyses, so any effects should have canceled.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Constraints on generality</head><p>Our primary results generalized well over choice domains, domain positions, aspect orders, and model specifications. The results should also hold for options with more extreme probabilities (DeKay &amp; <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Garge, 2023)</ref>, but they should not be generalized to problems with somewhat risky options <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(DeKay et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Garge, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Schneider, 1992)</ref> or to other situations not considered here. We also note that our interval-scaled EVA model is not a general theory of risky choice; unlike other theories, EVA has not been applied beyond riskychoice framing effects.</p><p>One may also ask whether our results can be generalized from our CloudResearch and student samples to broader populations in the United States or elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Hanel &amp; Vione, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Protzko et al., 2023)</ref>. Perhaps surprisingly, many social-science results from online convenience samples replicate very well in nationally representative samples because the effect sizes do not vary much across subgroups (see <ref type="bibr">Coppock et al.'s, 2018, analysis of 27 effects)</ref>. It is thus somewhat reassuring that our results do not vary with demographics in ways that would imply smaller effects in more representative samples (see the Supplemental Material). For valence and gist differences, results like ours have also been obtained among postcollege adults and intelligence agents in the United States <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Reyna et al., 2014)</ref> and among participants from several other countries (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Kühberger &amp; Tanner, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Zhou et al., 2021)</ref>. On the other hand, the residual framing effect appears to contradict previous results for subsets of our design <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Broniatowski &amp; Reyna, 2018)</ref>, though hints of residual framing effects have also been reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(DeKay et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Reyna et al., 2021)</ref>. This effect, especially, warrants additional replication in more representative samples to establish its generality.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Valence-and gist-based accounts do a good job of explaining variation in the direction and magnitude of the risky-choice framing effect over a variety of choices involving completely and incompletely described options, but they do not fully account for the framing effect.
