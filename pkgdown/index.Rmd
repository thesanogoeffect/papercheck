PaperCheck provides extendanble and integrated tools for automatically checking scientific papers for best practices, developed by Lisa DeBruine and Daniel Lakens in 2024 during Lisa’s visiting professorship at the Eindhoven Artificial Intelligence Systems Institute (EAISI). 


## Installation

You can install the development version of papercheck from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("scienceverse/papercheck")
```

You can launch an interactive shiny app version of the code below with:

``` r
papercheck_app()
```

## Example

```{r}
library(papercheck)
```

Convert a PDF to grobid XML format, then read it in as a paper object.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
pdf <- demopdf() # use the path of your own PDF
grobid <- pdf2grobid(pdf)
paper <- read_grobid(grobid)
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
# load paper without need for grobid server online
paper <- demoxml() |> read_grobid()
```


### Search Text 

Search the returned text. The regex pattern below searches for text that looks like statistical values (e.g., `N=313` or `p = 0.17`).

```{r}
pattern <- "[a-zA-Z]\\S*\\s*(=|<)\\s*[0-9\\.-]*\\d"
text <- search_text(paper, pattern, 
                    return = "match", 
                    perl = TRUE)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(text)
```


## Batch Processing

The functions `pdf2grobid()` and `read_grobid()` also work on a folder of files, returning a list of XML file paths or paper objects, respectively. The functions `search_text()`, `expand_text()` and `llm()` also work on a list of paper objects.

```{r}
# read in all the XML files in the demo directory
grobid_dir <- demodir()
papers <- read_grobid(grobid_dir)

# select sentences in the intros containing the text "previous"
previous <- search_text(papers, "previous", 
                        section = "intro", 
                        return = "sentence")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(previous)
```

### Large Language Models

You can query the extracted text of papers with LLMs using [groq](https://console.groq.com/docs/). See `?llm` for details of how to get and set up your API key, choose an LLM, and adjust settings. 

Use `search_text()` first to narrow down the text into what you want to query. Below, we limited search to the first two papers' introduction sections, and returned the full section. Then we asked an LLM "What is the hypothesis of this study?".

```{r, eval = FALSE}
hypotheses <- search_text(papers[1:2], 
                          section = "intro", 
                          return = "section")
query <- "What is the hypothesis of this study? Answer as briefly as possible."
llm_hypo <- llm(hypotheses, query, seed = 8675309)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
llm_hypo <- data.frame(
  id = c("eyecolor", "incest"),
  answer = c("The hypothesis of this study is that people's partner choice is influenced by positive sexual imprinting, meaning that they are attracted to partners who resemble their opposite-sex parent.", 
             "The hypothesis is that moral opposition to third-party sibling incest is greater among people who have other-sex siblings than among people who do not have other-sex siblings.")
)

knitr::kable(llm_hypo)
```

### Modules

Papercheck is designed modularly, so you can add modules to check for anything. It comes with a set of pre-defined modules, and we hope people will share more modules.

You can see the list of built-in modules with the function below.

```{r, results='asis'}
module_list()
```

To run a built-in module on a paper, you can reference it by name.

```{r}
p <- module_run(paper, "all-p-values")
```


```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(p$table)
```

### Reports

You can generate a report from any set of modules. The default set is `c("imprecise-p", "marginal", "osf-check", "retractionwatch", "ref-consistency")`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
paper_path <- report(paper, output_format = "html")
```
