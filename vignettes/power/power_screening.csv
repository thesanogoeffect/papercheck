"Study 2a participants provided two observations, and 2b participants six; in each case we targeted 1,200 total observations (preregistration links noted in the open practices section provide a priori power analyses justifying this sample size).",method,Method,14,2,1,09567976241258149
"We initially targeted 240 participants-160 representing the majority who rarely or never react to politicians' tweets, and 80 of the more unusual participants who frequently do so (for a priori power analyses justifying this sample size, see the preregistration).",method,Method,18,2,4,09567976241258149
Sensitivity analyses indicated we had over 95% power to detect even small effects (d = 0.22).,method,Method,25,2,4,09567976241258149
"The modest sample size in our experiments might not guarantee adequate power for relating the magnitude of the effect of statistical learning on conscious access to individual participants' awareness of the regularities (Vadillo et al., 2020).",method,Procedure,7,5,3,09567976241263344
"As mentioned above, the results here provide only weak evidence for the level of awareness of the regularity of the participants and need to be interpreted with caution because of the limitations of the methods (e.g., lack of statistical power).",results,The subjective-awareness ratings,11,1,3,09567976241263344
"Again, these findings provide only weak evidence for the absence of a relation between awareness of the regularity and conscious access, and they should be approached with caution because of the methodological constraints (e.g., lack of statistical power).",results,The subjective-awareness ratings,16,1,3,09567976241263344
"After reviewing the effect size (Cohen's d = 0.34) of a previous study that used the bias-free b-CFS paradigm to measure conscious access (Litwin et al., 2023), we concluded that a sample of 55 participants was needed for an experimental power of 80% with an alpha level of 0.05 for a planned one-tailed paired-samples t test (power calculation performed in G*Power).",method,Participants,18,1,1,09567976241263344
Our power analysis indicated that a sample of 42 participants per age group would provide 80% power to detect differences in group means (α = .05).,intro,Statement of Relevance,2,1,12,09567976241263347
"However, the achieved sample is still powered (77%) to detect a medium-sized effect (0.55), so we moved our stopping rule to 35 (our obtained sample) prior to data analysis.",intro,Statement of Relevance,2,1,14,09567976241263347
"This power analysis indicated that a sample size of 60 participants per age group would allow for at least 80% power to detect group differences at the standard alpha error probability of .05; however, we did not reach our full child-sample goal because of COVID-19.",intro,Participants,5,2,2,09567976241263347
The sample size for Experiment 2 was selected according to a simulation-based bootstrap power analysis so as to give in excess of 95% power to detect a betweenparticipants effect size estimated from permuted data from Experiment 1 (estimated between-participants Cohen's d = 0.63).,method,Participants,6,3,2,09567976241266516
"As part of the a priori power analyses that we performed when planning Experiment 2, we also calculated the betweenparticipants Cohen's d for Experiment 1 (between-participants d = 0.63).",annex,Supplemental Material,18,2,3,09567976241266516
"With a sample size of 20, the power was 100%.",method,Justification for sample size,4,1,4,09567976241279291
