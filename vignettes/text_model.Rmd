You can build a simple general linear model to predict the classification of text strings.

## Set up ground truth

See the [metascience vignette](metascience.html) for an explanation of how to set up a ground truth table. Here, we're going to split our data into a training and test set.

```{r}
ground_truth <- readr::read_csv("power/power_screening_coded.csv", 
                         show_col_types = FALSE)

train <- slice_sample(ground_truth, prop = 0.5)
test <- anti_join(ground_truth, train, by = "text")
```




## Get important words

You can use any method for finding the words you want to use in your model, but papercheck has a built-in function to find the words that are most distinctive in your classification groups. The classification values here are 0 and 1, but can be TRUE/FALSE or any two text values.

`n_X` is the total number of incidents of the word in category X, while `freq_X` is the average number of incidents per text string in category X (so can be higher than 1 if a word tends to be found several times per sentence). The table gives you the top `n` words with the largest absolute difference in frequency.

```{r}
words <- distinctive_words(
  text = train$text,
  classification = train$power_computation,
  n = 10
)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(words, digits = 2)
```


By default, the function will "stem" words using the "porter" algorithm. For example, "sampl" will match "sample", "samples" and "sampling". If your text is not English, check `SnowballC::getStemLanguages()` for other supported languages, or set `stem_language = FALSE`. 

You can get rid of words that you think will be irrelevant (even if they are predictive of classification in this data set) by adding them to `stop_words`. The `tidytext::stop_words` object gives you a list of common stop words, but this includes words like "above", "according", or "small", so use this with caution. 

The "###" value represents any number (the default setting for the `numbers` argument). We can set the `numbers` argument to "specific" to see if there are any specific numbers associated with power analyses.

```{r}
words <- distinctive_words(
  text = train$text,
  classification = train$power_computation,
  n = 10,
  numbers = "specific",
  stop_words = c("the", "a", "of", "an", "and")
)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(words, digits = 2)
```

## Code text features

Next, code the features of your ground truth text using `text_features()`. This will give you a data frame that codes 0 or 1 for the absence or presence of each word or feature.

* `word_count` defaults to TRUE, and returns the number of words in each text string. 
* `has_number` defaults to TRUE, and checks for any number in your text. If "###" is in your words list, this will be automatically set to TRUE. 
* `has_symbols` is a named vector of non-word strings (use regex) that you want to detect. 
* `values` defaults to "presence" and returns 0 or 1 for the presence of a word in each text string, while "count" returns the number of incidences of the word per string. 

```{r}
has_symbols <- c(has_equals = "=", 
                 has_percent = "%")

features <- text_features(
  text = train$text, 
  words = words$word,
  word_count = FALSE, 
  has_number = TRUE,
  has_symbol = has_symbols, 
  values = "presence" # presence or count
)

# show the first row
features[1, ] |> str()
```

## Train a model

You can then use this feature data to train a model. Here, we're using a simple binomial logistic regression to predict the classification from all of the features.

```{r}
# Train logistic regression model
model <- glm(train$power_computation ~ .,
             data = features,
             family = "binomial")

summary(model)
```

You can use any model you like and any method to assess and choose the best model.


## Predict classification

Now you can classify any text using this model. First, we're going to predict the classification of the original training data. Use `text_features()` to get the feature data and `predict()` to return the model response, and compare this result to a threshold (here 0.5) to generate the predicted classification.

```{r}
train$model_response <- predict(model, features)
```


```{r}
#| echo: false
ggplot(train, aes(x = model_response, 
                  color = factor(power_computation, 0:1, c("No", "Yes")))) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, color = "grey40") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = "grey40") +
  geom_density(linewidth = 1.5) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("dodgerblue", "firebrick")) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = -100:100) +
  guides(
    colour = guide_legend(position = "inside")
  ) +
  labs(x = "Model Response",
       y = NULL,
       color = "Power Computation") +
  theme(legend.position.inside = c(.8, .8), 
        axis.text.y = element_blank(),
        legend.background = element_blank()
        )
```

You can see that it's just below 0 that Yes values become more probable than No values. Remeber, this will change a bite depending on your sample, so you don't need to optimize the threshold to two decimal places or anything.

>[!NOTE]
> You need to consider the use of your classification when setting a threshold. Do you want to be over-inclusive and have another step to weed out false positives? Or under-inclusive and be absolutely sure that you only classify a sentence as having a power analysis when it defiitely does? Or do you want to balance these two types of error?

```{r}
train$power_computation_predict <- train$model_response > 0

dplyr::count(train, 
             power_computation, 
             power_computation_predict)
```

Now you should test this on a new set of data.

```{r}
test_features <- text_features(
  text = test$text, 
  words = words,
  word_count = FALSE, 
  has_number = TRUE,
  has_symbol = has_symbols, 
  values = "presence" # presence or count
)
test$model_response <- predict(model, test_features)

test$power_computation_predict <- test$model_response > 0

dplyr::count(test, 
             power_computation, 
             power_computation_predict)
```


## Create a module

To create a module for this, you will need to save your model and create a module with code.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
saveRDS(model, "power/power_log_model.Rds")
```


```{r, eval=FALSE}
#' Power Log Model
power_log_model <- function(paper) {
  # initial text search
  table <- paper |>
    papercheck::search_text("power(ed)?\\b") |>
    papercheck::search_text("(\\.[0-9]|[0-9]%)")

  # get text features
  words <- c("size", "sampl", "effect", "particip", "α", "analysi", "80", 
"in", "detect", "we")

  has_symbols <- c(has_equals = "=",
                   has_percent = "%")

  features <- text_features(
    text = table$text,
    words = words,
    word_count = FALSE,
    has_number = TRUE,
    has_symbol = has_symbols,
    values = "presence" # presence or count
  )

  # predict response from model
  model <- readRDS("power_log_model.Rds")
  table$model_response <- predict(model, features)
  table$power_computation_predict <- table$model_response > 0

  # summarise by paper
  summary_table <- table[table$power_computation_predict, ] |>
    dplyr::count(id, name = "n_power")

  list(
    table = table,
    summary = summary_table,
    na_replace = 0
  )
}
```

Now you can use `module_run()` to run the module on a new paper or set of papers.

```{r}
m <- demodir() |> read_grobid() |>
  module_run("power/power_log_model.R")
```

```{r}
m$table[, c("id", "model_response", "power_computation_predict", "text")]
```

```{r}
m$summary
```
